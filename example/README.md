# Flutter Amplify Auth UI Example

This example demonstrates how the flutter_amplify_auth_ui plugin uses an Amplify configuration
to generate Authentication widgets.

By executing the command from [example.sh](example.sh)
you generate Flutter widgets into the [target](target) folder that are based on the sample
Amplify configuration in the [amplify](amplify) folder.

## Usage

`./example.sh`

or

```
flutter packages pub run flutter_amplify_auth_ui:main --amplifyDir=./example/amplify --targetDir=./example/target
```
